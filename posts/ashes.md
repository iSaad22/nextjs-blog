**Introduction**: The Ashes is the **oldest** rivalry in the Cricketing world and is commonly known as one of the most **interesting** battles. It is a Test series usually comprising 5 Test matches played once in at least two years between England and Australia. One year, England hosts it and the next year Australia. The trophy of The Ashes series is probably the **smallest** in shape but has the **largest** importance in Test cricket history. The history of Ashes series describes why it is that significant.


**History of The Ashes:** The term 'Ashes’ was first used in a **British newspaper** after Australia's victory in The Oval test match in **1982** when Australia won its first ever test match on English soil. The headline stated a kind of death notice that said, **“The body will be cremated and the Ashes taken to Australia”.** After this statement, the name 'Ashes’ was immediately associated with the Test series and its first ever edition took place in **1982-83** in Australia. And since that time, it has its own magnitude in the history of both the countries.

**The Ashes Urn:** The trophy of The Ashes is said to be The Ashes Urn, it is made up of terracotta, and is a mere 6
inches tall. The uniqueness about this little Urn is it is reputed to contain the ashes of a **burnt Cricket bail**. The interesting fact about it is that it was not the official trophy of the Ashes from the beginning; it became the actual
representation of this Test series in the 1998-99 season. One more thing to be noticed about it is that it is always kept in the **MCC Museum** located in the Lord's despite the fact which team won it recently.

**Results and Statistics:** The Ashes is known to be the most fascinating rivalry due to a reason and the cause is the quality and competition of cricket played. The history of The Ashes series is **136** years old, and in that period of time, a total of **330** test matches have been played between both teams. Out of those **330** encounters, 134 have been won by
Australia. On the other hand, **106** went in favor of England. While **90** matches ended in a draw. This rivalry becomes more aggressive when we look at the result series wise. England and Australia played **70** Ashes series among them, 33 belonged to Australia and 32 were won by England. This stat is enough to show the quality of cricket played where even after such a long history, both the teams cannot be differentiated based on the results. But I've an attractive figure which is often not looked after or I guess no one ever bothered to find out is, out of those 136 years, The Ashes was held by Australia for approximately 80.5 years and for the rest of the **55.5** years, it was with England. Moreover, in terms of individuals, Australia is ahead as well. **264**
hundreds have come from the Australia side while only **220** from England's. In bowling, Aussies lead too. Having taken **10** wickets in a match **41** times compared to England's tally of **38**.

Best of The Ashes: There has been plenty of unforgettable matches being played in The Ashes history, but based on
my personal experience, I found 3 such matches since 2005 (I started following Cricket) that can't be erased from a cricket fan's brain;

**#1: Edgbaston, 2005:** England proved Ricky Ponting's decision wrong after he decided to field first by scoring 407
in 1st innings. In response, Australia fell 99 runs short, England was sitting very contently but Australia didn't go down without fighting and dismissed England for just 182 leaving Australia 282 to win. Chasing 282, Australia was abridged to 175/8 when Warne joined Lee and took the score to 220, Lee and Kasprowicz were required to score remaining 62 for the last wicket, they put a valiant effort but fell just TWO runs short.

**#2: Headingley, 2019:** Australia was put in to bat by Joe Root and his decision was proved right by Jofra Archer,
who took 6 for 45 and condensed Australia to an ordinary 179 but who knew Josh Hazlewood would go one step ahead and would take 5 for 30 which bundled English
lineup on just 67. In the second inning, it was 50-50 among both parties, Australia set a target of 359 with 2 days left. At Lunch Day 4, England was happily sitting at 238/4 before a mini collapse happened and Stokes and Leach, the last
pair, was left with 76 to win and Ben Stokes then made history and assisted England chased its highest ever run chase.

**#3: Cardiff, 2009:** England batted first and half centuries from Pieterson, Collingwood and Prior took England to
435. In counter, Australian batsman answered 3 half centurion from England by scoring 4 tons courtesy Katich, Pointing, North and Haddin. When England came
out to bat for a second time, it was up to them to bat the whole last day to save the test match but it looked like not occurring when they were reduced to 233/9 with more than 11 overs to go. Panesar and Anderson were supposed to be 1 ball guests, but they traumatized everyone but batting out the remaining 11.3 overs.
